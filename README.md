### Task Tracker
This is a simple program that allows you to track your time spent on tasks.  
This is useful when you have to switch between tasks frequently.  
It will also store your progress in a json file that shows you a summary of time spent. This summary is grouped by pay periods, I hardcoded this, so if you want to change it you will have to alter the code.
